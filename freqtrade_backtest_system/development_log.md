To implement the new features outlined in the updated `requirements.md` document. I will work independently and document my progress here.

### Plan
1.  **Enhance Core Analytics**: **DONE**

    *   Update the `BacktestResult` data model to store these new metrics.
    *   Write unit tests for the new metric calculations.

2.  **Develop Advanced Visualization**: **DONE**
    *   Create a new component for advanced charting.
    *   Implement functions to generate Equity Curves, Drawdown Plots, and trade markers on candlestick charts.
    *   Integrate these new visualizations into the results analysis page.

3.  **Implement Hyperopt UI**: **DONE**
    *   Develop a backend `HyperoptExecutor` to run `freqtrade hyperopt`.
    *   Design a new UI panel for configuring and launching Hyperopt tasks.
    *   Create a view to display Hyperopt results.
    *   Add unit tests for the Hyperopt executor.

4.  **Improve Dry Run Monitoring**: **DONE**
    *   Enhance the `DryRunExecutor` to parse real-time trade and balance information.
    *   Build a real-time dashboard in the UI with live charts and metrics.

5.  **Testing and Refinement**: **DONE**
    *   Continuously create unit and integration tests for new components.
    *   Establish a `tests/fixtures` directory for test data.
    *   Update the `tasks.md` file as features are completed.
